# CakePHP Gearman plugin

Gearman task offloading for CakePHP 3.

## Requirements

- CakePHP 3.0+
- [Gearman](http://gearman.org)

## Why use this plugin?

Use this plugin to drastically reduce page load times by offloading
time consuming processes (like sending emails and resizing uploaded images) to
the Gearman Job Server on your local system.

## Installation

Install the plugin using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```
composer require cvo-technologies/cakephp-gearman
```

Now load the plugin by either running this shell command:

```
bin/cake plugin load CvoTechnologies/Gearman --bootstrap
```

or by manually adding the following line to ``config/bootstrap.php``:

```php
Plugin::load('CvoTechnologies/Gearman', ['bootstrap' => true]);
```

Lastly, add a new `Gearman` configuration section to (most likely) `app.php`:

```php
    'Gearman' => [
        'Servers' => [
            '127.0.0.1:4730'
        ],
        'Jobs' => [

        ]
    ]
```

### Optional: system verification

Before proceeding you might want to verify that the
[Gearman Job Server](http://gearman.org//getting-started) is actually up
and running on your local system.

On Ubuntu systems running `sudo netstat -peanut | grep gearman` should
produce something similar to:

```
tcp      0     0 127.0.0.1:4730     0.0.0.0:*     LISTEN     0     9727     625/gearmand
tcp6     0     0 ::1:4730           :::*          LISTEN     0     9726     625/gearmand
```

## Usage

Using this plugin comes down to:

1. Configuring your task(s)
2. Starting the `WorkerShell` on your local system
3. Offloading tasks from within your application code by using the `execute()`
function found in the `JobAwareTrait`

To start the `WorkerShell` so it will listen for incoming tasks run the
following command on your local system:

```
bin/cake worker
```

## Built-in Tasks

### Email Task

This plugin comes with a built-in email task that allows you to start
offloading emails using the worker instantly.

To enable the email task first add the following job to your Gearman
configuration section:

```php
    'Jobs' => [
        'className' => 'Email'
    ]
```

Then add the following worker configuration to your existing EmailTransporter
configuration section (most likely found in `app.php`):

>>>>>>> Documentation rewrite
```php
'worker' => [
    'className' => 'CvoTechnologies/Gearman.Worker',
    'transport' => 'default',
    'background' => true
]
```

Now all you need to do is use this EmailTransporter in your application
when sending emails and it will automatically offload all email sending to the
built-in task using the EmailTransporter defined in the `transport` key. E.g.

```php
$email = new Email('default');
$res = $email->from(['you@example.com' => 'Your Site'])
    ->to('recipient@sexample.com')
    ->subject('Testing cakephp-gearman built-in EmailTask')
    ->send('Your message');
```

If things went well you should see the worker providing feedback on tasks being
processed shown below:

## Creating your own tasks

### 1. Create the Task

As an example we will create the following `SleepTask` that:

- will be used as a Gearman job
- must be created in `src/Shell/Task/SleepTask.php`
- must contain a `main()` function

```php
<?php
namespace CvoTechnologies\Gearman\Shell\Task;

use Cake\Console\Shell;

class SleepTask extends Shell
{

    public function main($workload, GearmanJob $job)
    {
        $job->sendStatus(0, 3);

        sleep($workload['timeout']);

        $job->sendStatus(1, 3);

        sleep($workload['timeout']);

        $job->sendStatus(2, 3);

        sleep($workload['timeout']);

        return array(
            'total_timeout' => $workload['timeout'] * 3
        );
    }
}
```

> Please note that the plugin will take care of arrays and objects. When you
> submit an array in the task, you will receive an array in the workload.

### 2. Start using the task

To start using the task:

1. include the `JobAwareTrait` in your application code
2. use the `$this->execute` function to pass the job to Gearman

Please note that the `execute()` method takes the following parameters:

- `$name`: name of the job (task in cakephp)
- `$workload`: mixed, can be either an array, string, int or everything else
- `$background`: boolean, true to run in background
- `$priority`: Gearman::PRIORITY_NORMAL, _LOW, _NORMAL or _HIGH
